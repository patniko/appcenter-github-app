# Getting started

1. Install the latest Azure Functions CLI on your system. 
 
```npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@core ```
 
2. Create a database in Azure Portal and update `local.settings.json` with valid `DB_ID`, `DB_HOST` and `DB_AUTH_KEY` values.

3. Run the Azure Function locally to verify releases are being processed correctly.

```func host start â€“-debug vscode```

5. Link the project to your subscription before running by navigating to the Azure portal, creating a new Function called PrCheck underneath a subscription and running the command below to link the two.

```func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings AppCenterFunctions ```

6. Create a GitHub app and configure webhook url to point to `PrCheck` function and Setup Url, authorization callback url to point to `PrCheckSetup` function. 

7. When you create an app on GitHub, you will be prompted to generate a private key for it. Download it and put it under `PrCheck` folder named as `appcenter.pem`.

8. Provide a `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GH_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `GH_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` in local settings as it is available now.

9. Next, generate a public/private rsa keypair for encoding data stored in the database. This is done via `openssl genrsa -out private.pem` and `openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem`. 

10. Put a `public.pem` under `PrCheck` folder and `private.pem` under `PrCheckSetup` folder.

12. Publish the changes to the Azure portal using `func azure functionapp publish AppCenterFunctions publish -i`.
